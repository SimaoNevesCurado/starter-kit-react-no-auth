# Simao Curado Laravel Starter Kit (Inertia + React)

An opinionated Laravel 12 starter kit for developers who want strict, consistent, and production-focused defaults out of the box.

This project is based on Laravel + Inertia + React and adds a quality-first workflow with static analysis, automated refactoring, formatting, and strong testing requirements.

## Why This Starter Kit

- Actions-oriented structure for application logic
- Consistent CRUD-oriented organization across backend and frontend
- Strong typing and static analysis by default
- Strict quality gates with Rector, Pint, ESLint, and TypeScript checks
- Fail-fast mindset through tests, type checks, and linting
- Better Laravel defaults via `nunomaduro/essentials`
- AI-ready project setup with Boost and agent guidelines
